# Ant elevational biodiversity gradient

This repositiory contains the code to run the case study example analysis from
the manuscript by McGlinn et al. (2020).

## Data

The case study is a reanalysis of ant community data collected in the Great
Smokies National Park with seven additional sites (Sanders et al. 2007).

The raw data files (NOT MEANT FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS) were provided by Nathan Sanders: 

`./data/180926-AllRawData.xlsx`

which contains the community matrix of ant abundances and the site attributes.
Note that this raw file does have a few small mistakes that are corrected
in the data processing and cleaning step described below. Therefore, future
re-analysis of the data should used the cleaned data and not the raw data. 
Sanders also provided: 

`./data/smokies_species_list.xlsx`

which contains the ant species list.
Ant taxonomy follows Bolton and were updated on Sept 26, 2018

The cleaned datafiles have been also published on Dryad ([Sanders et al.
2021](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.z8w9ghx7g)):


## Reproducing the results of McGlinn et al. 

To run the data processing and data analysis R scripts the following 
packages must be installed

```r
install.packages(c('mobr', 'readxl', 'janitor', 
                   'leaflet', 'mapview', 'tidyr',
                   'vegan', 'dplyr', 'ggplot2', 
                   'egg', 'broom'))
```

### Data processing 

The script to process the raw data files into cleaned data files that were then 
posted to Dryad ([Sanders et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.z8w9ghx7g))
and analyzed is:
 
`./scripts/data_processing.R`

The cleaned data file is located at 

`./data/dryad/smokies_all.csv`

and the metadata for that file is given in

`./data/dryad/smokies_all_metadata.csv`

### Data analysis

The script to carry out the analysis published in McGlinn et al. (accepted) is:

`./scripts/univariate_gradients.R`
