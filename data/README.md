# Data README 

The raw data files (NOT MEANT FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS) were provided by Nathan Sanders: 

`./data/180926-AllRawData.xlsx`

which contains the community matrix of ant abundances and the site attributes.
Note that this raw file does have a few small mistakes that are corrected
in the data processing and cleaning script `./scripts/data_processing.R`.
Therefore, future re-analysis of the data should used the cleaned data and
not the raw data. 
Sanders also provided: 

`./data/smokies_species_list.xlsx`

which contains the ant species list.
Ant taxonomy follows Bolton and were updated on Sept 26, 2018

**Future reanalysis of the data should use the files shared posted on Dryad 
([Sanders et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.z8w9ghx7g))
located in the folder called `dryad`.**
