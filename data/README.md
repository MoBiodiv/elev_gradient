# Data README 

The raw data files (NOT MEANT FOR FUTURE ANALYSIS) were provided by Nathan Sanders: 

`./data/180926-AllRawData.xlsx`

which contains the community matrix of ant abundances and the site attributes.
Note that this raw file does have a few small mistakes that are corrected
in the data processing and cleaning script `./scripts/data_processing.R`.
Therefore, future re-analysis of the data should used the cleaned data and
not the raw data. 
Sanders also provided: 

`./data/smokies_species_list.xlsx`

which contains the ant species list.
Ant taxonomy follows Bolton and were updated on Sept 26, 2018

Future reanalysis of the data should use the files shared on Dryad which are
located in the folder called `dryad`.
